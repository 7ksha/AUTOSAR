# AI-Enhanced AUTOSAR OS for Energy-Efficient Autonomous Vehicles

---

## **1. Introduction & Motivation**

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) rely on complex software architectures to manage multiple sensors (cameras, LiDAR, radar), perception algorithms, control systems, and connectivity modules (V2X). The **AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture)** standard has emerged as the backbone of automotive software, ensuring modularity, safety, and interoperability.

However, as computational demand increases, vehicles face challenges related to **high power consumption, thermal constraints, and task scheduling conflicts**. Modern AVs must efficiently allocate **CPU/GPU resources** across safety-critical and non-critical tasks while minimizing power usage.

This project proposes an **AI-enhanced extension of Adaptive AUTOSAR OS** that integrates an **intelligent Power & Task Manager**. This module will dynamically optimize CPU/GPU utilization across tasks (vision, control, V2X, infotainment) using machine learning and reinforcement learning approaches, thereby improving **energy efficiency, real-time responsiveness, and system reliability**.

## **2. Project Objectives**

The key objectives of this project are:

1. **Develop a simplified Adaptive AUTOSAR OS environment** to emulate real-world ECU scheduling and task management.
2. **Design and implement an AI-powered Power Manager** capable of:

   * Dynamically reordering task priorities based on system state and driving context.
   * Optimizing CPU/GPU usage to minimize energy consumption.
   * Predicting future workload patterns (traffic density, road type) to proactively allocate resources.
3. **Simulate and test the enhanced AUTOSAR OS** using automotive-grade simulators (CARLA, Vector tools) under realistic driving scenarios.
4. **Measure and evaluate improvements** in energy consumption, scheduling latency, and system safety compared to baseline AUTOSAR scheduling.
5. **Visualize results** via an interactive dashboard that displays task allocation, CPU/GPU usage, and energy efficiency metrics.
